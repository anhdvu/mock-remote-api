
## This repo is here to remind me of how I started with Go and how I fell in love with it.
- There are a lot of anti-pattern code.
- There is no test at all.
- Everything is exported.
- Only stdlib was used. *yay*
- The code is still functional and does its job.
- I learned what a pointer is and how to use it.
- I learned how to use interface.
- I learned how to implement pre-existing interfaces in stdlib.
- I learned how to write a custom XML marshaller.
